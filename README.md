NOTHAWTHORNE'S PREAMBLE
=======================
I don't like being a server admin. I'd love it if someone wanted to host this server instead, deal with all of the administration duties while I develop. I also believe that open source is the best way to do things in this community. Use the scripts if you want, and if you decide to host/admin the server, drop me a line on Skype @ vulcan445.

FAQ
===
Q: entropypvp.lua won't work!
A: You need empty vendor NPCs with entryID's of 818001-818010 for the script to work correctly. 

Q: _______ is buggy/poorly scripted!
A: I know. Few things in this repository are 100% finished, and my coding ability is subpar at that. On top of that, none of these scripts have the commenting necessary for people to easily understand what each part of my scripts are for. This is because this repository is nothing, at the moment, but a personal project that I've only uploaded for any parties interested in contributing to or using these scripts.
